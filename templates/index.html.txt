  <h2>Welcome to Food Donation & Waste Management System</h2>

  <p>1. The Food Donation & Waste Management System connects donors, NGOs, and needy individuals on one platform.</p>
  <p>2. It helps reduce food wastage by redistributing excess food from restaurants, homes, and events.</p>
  <p>3. Users can view available food donations near their location and place a request easily.</p>
  <p>4. Donors can upload available food details, including type, quantity, and expiry time.</p>
  <p>5. The system verifies every request through valid proof to ensure genuine distribution.</p>
  <p>6. Volunteers help deliver food safely from donors to recipients under admin supervision.</p>
  <p>7. The admin monitors all activities, including donation approvals and deliveries.</p>
  <p>8. The system promotes transparency and accountability in every donation process.</p>
  <p>9. It supports the goal of “Zero Hunger” by connecting people who can help with those in need.</p>
  <p>10. Together, we make sure no food is wasted and no one sleeps hungry.</p>
